This package lets you create a medium with multiple GNU/linux ISOs on it, each
of them chain-bootable when the medium itself is booted.

This requires GRUB2 version 1.99 or later.

Instructions:

- insert your physical device, or create a virtual disk image file using `./imgctl create`
- install the bootloader
	- mount your device's boot partition onto some $MNT directory
		- let $BOOT be the boot directory, which should either be $MNT/ or $MNT/boot/
	- run ./imgctl install $BOOT $DEVICE
- install your data
	- mount your device's data partition onto some $MNT directory.
		- this can be the same as $MNT above, or different. it's up to you.
		- let $DATA be the data directory, which should either be $MNT/ or $MNT/boot/
	- copy your ISOs to $DATA/img/
	- copy any overrides (if you have/need any, which should be rare) to $DATA/linux/ and $DATA/initrd/
		- the override for XXXX.iso should be named XXXX.*
		- e.g. XXXX.vmlinuz or XXXX.initrd.gz
		- e.g. Backtrack 5 needs a newer version of casper-generated /scripts/ for its initrd
- use `./imgctl test <image file|device>` to test it with QEMU.

If you get "Unsupported ISO type" for any of your ISOs, file me a bug! If this
script can be modified to support it, I will do so; otherwise I will tell you to
file a bug to the upstream ISO developers.
