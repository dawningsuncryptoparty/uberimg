This package lets you create a medium with multiple GNU/linux ISOs on it, each
of them chain-bootable when the medium itself is booted.

This requires GRUB2 version 1.99 or later.

Instructions:

- prepare your device. you can create a virtual disk image file using `./imgctl create`
- mount your device's boot partition onto some $MNT directory
- let $BOOT be the boot directory, which should either be $MNT or $MNT/boot
- copy your ISOs to $BOOT/iso (or $BOOT/bootiso or $BOOT/img)
- run ./imgctl install $BOOT $DEVICE
- copy isodetect.cfg to $BOOT/grub/grub.cfg on your medium

- test your device. (if it's a image file, you can use `./imgctl test` to test it with QEMU.)
- the isodetect should detect most linux ISOs, and make them bootable
