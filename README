This package lets you create a medium with multiple GNU/linux ISOs on it, each
of them chain-bootable when the medium itself is booted.

This requires GRUB2 version 1.99 or later.

Instructions:

- prepare your device. you can create a virtual disk image file using `./imgctl create`
- mount your device's boot partition onto some $MNT directory
- let $BOOT be the boot directory, which should either be $MNT/ or $MNT/boot/
- copy your ISOs to $BOOT/img/
- copy any overrides to $BOOT/linux/ and $BOOT/initrd/
	- the override for XXXX.iso should be named XXXX.*
	- e.g. XXXX.vmlinuz or XXXX.initrd.gz
	- e.g. Backtrack 5 needs a newer version of casper-generated /scripts/ for its initrd
- run ./imgctl install $BOOT $DEVICE
- copy isodetect.cfg to $BOOT/grub/grub.cfg on your medium

- test your device. if it's a image file, you can use `./imgctl test` to test it with QEMU.
- the isodetect should detect most linux ISOs, and make them bootable
